A while a go, I went on an urban architecture tour with 
[Ticket B](https://ticket-b.de/en/){target="_blank"} (highly recommended!)
to the 
[Rummelsburg Bay](https://ticket-b.de/en/tour/rummelsburg/){target="_blank"}. 
Though not exactly within the scope of the tour, the guide showed a map of
the 
[Berlin Industrial Exposition of 1896](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Industrial_Exposition_of_Berlin){target="_blank"}
at the starting point of the tour, 
[Treptow Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Treptower_Park_station){target="_blank"} station.

Now that map fascinated me for different reasons. I am very familiar with the
Treptow park, where you'll find me running several times per week all year
round. It's a very nice park, with access to river 
[Spree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spree){target="_blank"}, many old
shady trees, extensive meadows, a romantic little 
[lake](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karpfenteich_(Berlin)){target="_blank"}, 
the 
[*Island of Youth*](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insel_der_Jugend){target="_blank"}
(with one of my favorite beer gardens and a canoe rental), but also the truly monumental 
[Soviet War Memorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_War_Memorial_(Treptower_Park)){target="_blank"}
, commemorating Red Army soldiers fallen in the Battle of Berlin in 1945.

What is now the park, was the grounds of the great expo in 1896. The map shows 
lots of infrastructure, many large building structures and ensembles of smaller
buildings, e.g. replicas of the Spandau Old City and of villages in Cameroon, 
Togo and New Guinea -- as the infamous 
[German Colonial Exhhibition](https://blackcentraleurope.com/sources/1850-1914/the-first-german-colonial-exhibition-1896/){target="_blank"} was a part of the expo.

Walking (or running) under the shade of the park's trees today, you would not 
expect this place to have been host to all that.  Apart from the
[Archenhold Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archenhold_Observatory){target="_blank"},
hardly anything of it still exists. But traces of it can still be seen in the 
structure of the park. This applies most of all for the Soviet War Memorial, 
which is clearly build on the footprint of what once was the artificial New
Lake ("Neuer See").

I was glad to find 
[this map at Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Berliner_Gewerbeausstellung_1896_02.jpg){target="_blank"}. I georeferenced it and made a little interactive
webmap of it using 
[react-geo](https://terrestris.github.io/react-geo/){target="_blank"}
. As the map is not north-oriented, I used 
[OpenLayer's rotation controls](https://openlayers.org/en/latest/apidoc/module-ol_control_Rotate.html){target="_blank"} 
to create a button that lets you switch to the original orientation of the map 
and back. Using the opacity controls, you can discover the remaining traces
of the great expo in the design of today's park.
