I recently found out about *[exactextract](https://github.com/isciences/exactextract){target="_blank"}* (and its R wrapper *[exactextractR](https://github.com/isciences/exactextractr){target="_blank"}*). It is a tool for the extraction of zonal statistics from raster data, and it's pure magic -- it is incredibly fast and more accurate than other algorithms, as it considers partial coverage of pixels by polygons and weights the pixel values accordingly when aggregating them.

Another interesting tool that I always wanted to try out is *[plumber](https://www.rplumber.io/){target="_blank"}*, an R package to easily create an API. So why not bring these tools together? I built a [plumber API](https://github.com/ofr1tz/plumber-api){target="_blank"} for a function that extracts zonal statistics from [WorldPop population counts](https://www.worldpop.org/geodata/listing?id=64){target="_blank"}, based on geographic point coordinates and a buffer radius in meter. The geodesic buffer is created with *[geobuffer](https://github.com/valentinitnelav/geobuffer){target="_blank"}* -- another excellent tool.

I wrote a little [Shiny app](https://github.com/ofr1tz/pickpop){target="_blank"} to interact with the API and to display the results on a [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/){target="_blank"} map. Meet [pickPop](https://shiny.oliverfritz.de/pickpop/){target="_blank"}!
