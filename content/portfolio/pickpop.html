<p>I recently found out about <em><a href="https://github.com/isciences/exactextract" target="_blank">exactextract</a></em> (and its R wrapper <em><a href="https://github.com/isciences/exactextractr" target="_blank">exactextractR</a></em>). It is a tool for the extraction of zonal statistics from raster data, and it’s pure magic – it is incredibly fast and more accurate than other algorithms, as it considers partial coverage of pixels by polygons and weights the pixel values accordingly when aggregating them.</p>
<p>Another interesting tool that I always wanted to try out is <em><a href="https://www.rplumber.io/" target="_blank">plumber</a></em>, an R package to easily create an API. So why not bring these tools together? I built a <a href="https://github.com/ofr1tz/plumber-api" target="_blank">plumber API</a> for a function that extracts zonal statistics from <a href="https://www.worldpop.org/geodata/listing?id=64" target="_blank">WorldPop population counts</a>, based on geographic point coordinates and a buffer radius in meter. The geodesic buffer is created with <em><a href="https://github.com/valentinitnelav/geobuffer" target="_blank">geobuffer</a></em> – another excellent tool.</p>
<p>I wrote a little <a href="https://github.com/ofr1tz/pickpop" target="_blank">Shiny app</a> to interact with the API and to display the results on a <a href="https://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">Leaflet</a> map.
