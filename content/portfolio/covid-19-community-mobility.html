<p>When Google first published its <a href="https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/" target="_blank">community mobility reports</a> in 2020, I – like many others – rushed to try and do something with it. I decided to use it as a pretext to build a <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/" target="_blank">Shiny</a> app with time controls on a <a href="https://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">Leaflet</a> map. I was surprised how easy it was to implement a time series animation with Shiny by simply setting the <code>animate</code> argument for the <code>sliderInput</code>. I used <a href="https://github.com/bnosac/cronR" target="_blank"><em>cronR</em></a> to create a cron job for the daily execution of a script that loads and processes the data. In this way, the app can show the most recent data and still fire up without too much delay.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Even if you are – quite understandably – no longer much inclined to spend your precious time on COVID-19 data yet again, this dataset provides insight that often goes beyond the impact of the pandemic, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quite obviously, the <em>Parks</em> layer is a nice indicator of good weather conditions, but it also clearly illustrates the distinction between a strict curfew imposed and a soft lockdown – leaving little else to do but to take a walk in the park;</li>
<li>Mobile internet blackouts, such as in the aftermath of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Belarusian_presidential_election" target="_blank">Belarusian presidential election</a> on August 10, 2020 or around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Ugandan_general_election" target="_blank">Ugandan general election</a> on January 14, 2021, are clearly visible in the data as “decreased mobility”;</li>
<li>It’s also easy to spot national holidays in the <em>Retail and Recreation</em> Layer.</li>
</ul>
