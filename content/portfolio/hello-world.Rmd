```

This website is new. I've been pondering on its creation for a while now. The start of the new year 2021 seems to be a good moment to finally launch it.

The website needs a nice "Hello, World!" article and a [favicon][1]. So why not combine both! As this here will be all about spatial data science and geovisualisation, I figured it would be rather fitting to use a map-themed icon and to create it in a reproducible way with R.

I use *rnaturalearth* to acquire country features, *ggplot2* from *tidyverse* and *sf* for visualisation and *rmapshaper* to simplify the polygon according to the small size of the desired icon. *ggpubr* provides a simple way to use transparent backgrounds in *ggplot2*.

```{r requirements, message = F, warning = F}
require(rnaturalearth)
require(tidyverse)
require(sf)
require(rmapshaper)
require(ggpubr)
```

Here's how I get the country features and simplify them:

```{r countries, message = F, warning = F}
countries <- ne_countries(returnclass = "sf") %>%
    ms_simplify()
```

For the globe shaped visualisation, I choose an orthographic projection with parameters that allow showing relatively much of the Earth's landmass, including my current home base. (Sorry, [New Zealand][2]!)

```{r proj, message = F, warning = F}
lat <- 45
lon <- -10
ortho <- paste0(
    "+proj=ortho +lat_0=", lat, 
    " +lon_0=", lon, 
    " +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +a=6371000 +b=6371000 +units=m +no_defs"
)
```

I plot it on a void canvas with a transparent background:

```{r plot, message = F, warning = F}
countries %>%
    ggplot() + 
    geom_sf(col = NA) + 
    coord_sf(crs = ortho) + 
    theme_void() + 
    theme_transparent()
```

Now I can save the plot in various sizes according to the needs of different browsers. Note the use of *cairo-png* with the *png* graphics device. This enables [antialiasing][3] and results in smoother polygon edges of the scaled icon. 

```{r save, eval = F}
ggsave(favicon192.png", width = 2, height = 2, dpi = 96, bg = "transparent", type = "cairo-png")
```

Voil√†!
