When Google first published its [community mobility reports](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/){target="_blank"} in 2020, I -- like many others -- rushed to try and do something with it. I decided to use it as a pretext to build a [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/){target="_blank"} app with time controls on a  [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/){target="_blank"} map. I was surprised how easy it was to implement a time series animation with Shiny by simply setting the `animate` argument for the `sliderInput`. I used [*cronR*](https://github.com/bnosac/cronR){target="_blank"} to create a cron job for the daily execution of a script that loads and processes the data. In this way, the app can show the most recent data and still fire up without too much delay.[^1]

Even if you are -- quite understandably -- no longer much inclined to spend your precious time on COVID-19 data yet again, this dataset provides insight that often goes beyond the impact of the pandemic, e.g.:

- Quite obviously, the *Parks* layer is a nice indicator of good weather conditions, but it also clearly illustrates the distinction between a strict curfew imposed and a soft lockdown -- leaving little else to do but to take a walk in the park; 
- Mobile internet blackouts, such as in the aftermath of the [Belarusian presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Belarusian_presidential_election){target="_blank"} on August 10, 2020 or around the [Ugandan general election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Ugandan_general_election){target="_blank"} on January 14, 2021, are clearly visible in the data as "decreased mobility";
- It's also easy to spot national holidays in the *Retail and Recreation* Layer.
