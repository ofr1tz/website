When Google first published its [community mobility reports](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/){target="_blank"} in 2020, I -- like many others -- rushed to try and do something with it. I decided to use it as a pretext to build a [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/){target="_blank"} app with time controls on a  [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/){target="_blank"} map. I was surprised how easy it was to implement a time series animation with Shiny by simply setting the `animate` argument for the `sliderInput`.[^1]

Even if you are -- quite understandably -- no longer much inclined to spend your precious time on COVID-19 data yet again, this dataset provides insight that often goes beyond the impact of the pandemic, e.g.:

- Quite obviously, the *Parks* layer is a nice indicator of good weather conditions, but it also clearly illustrates the distinction between a strict curfew imposed and a soft lockdown -- leaving little else to do but to take a walk in the park; 
- Mobile internet blackouts, such as in the aftermath of the [Belarusian presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Belarusian_presidential_election){target="_blank"} on August 10, 2020 or around the [Ugandan general election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Ugandan_general_election){target="_blank"} on January 14, 2021, are clearly visible in the data as "decreased mobility";
- It's also easy to spot national holidays in the *Retail and Recreation* Layer.

The following R script loads and processes the data set:

```{r update, eval = FALSE}
require(tidyverse)

# source shared variables used by update_data cron job and app
source("shared_vars.R")

if(!dir.exists("data")) { dir.create("data") }

temp <- try(read_csv(url), silent = T)
if(class(temp) != "try-error") {
	temp %>%
		filter(is.na(sub_region_1)) %>%
		rename(iso_a2 = country_region_code, country = country_region) %>%
		select(-sub_region_1, -sub_region_2, -metro_area) %>%
		gather("category", "mobility", -iso_a2, -country, -iso_3166_2_code, -census_fips_code, -date) %>%
		mutate(
			category = str_to_title(
				str_replace_all(str_replace(category, "_percent_change_from_baseline", ""), "_", " ")
			),
			bin = cut(
				mobility, 
				breaks = c(seq(-100, 100, 20), Inf), 
				labels = labels, 
				right = F
			)
		) %>%
		saveRDS(file)
}
```

I used [*cronR*](https://github.com/bnosac/cronR){target="_blank"} to create a cron job for the daily execution of this script:

```{r cron, eval = FALSE}
require(cronR)

r <- cron_rscript("update_data.R", workdir = here::here())
cron_add(r, frequency = "daily", at = "18:30", description = "update data")
```

In this way, the app can show the most recent data and still fire up without too much delay.
